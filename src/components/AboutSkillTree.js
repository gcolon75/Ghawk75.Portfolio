                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Gabriel Colon, a Cognitive Science major specializing in Human Interaction and Design, 
                    with a minor in Computational Social Science from UC San Diego. I'm passionate about the intersection 
                    of technology, design, and human behavior, with skills spanning project management, coding 
                    (Java, Python, Data Structures), and user experience design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the Social Chair of the Tritonthenix Calisthenics Club, I've honed skills in event planning, 
                    leadership, and teamwork while also expanding my technical abilities through coursework in HCI, 
                    data-driven UX design, and cognitive neuroscience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm always striving to combine my technical expertise with creative design, hoping to build 
                    products and experiences that inspire and empower others.
                </p>
            </div>
