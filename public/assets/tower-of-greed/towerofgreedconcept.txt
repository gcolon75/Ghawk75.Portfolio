TOWER OF GREED - CONCEPT SUMMARY
=================================

Tower of Greed is a dice-driven roguelike RPG where every turn balances risk and payoff. Players craft a customizable Attack Die, manage a resource-gated Subclass Die, and climb a perilous tower using smart sequencing over raw RNG.

CORE PILLARS
------------

1. CUSTOMIZABLE ATTACK DIE
   - Choose your die type: D4, D6, or D8
   - Each die has unique attunement capacity
   - Upgrade with Dice Shards throughout your run
   - Balance damage potential vs. consistency

2. SUBCLASS DIE SYSTEM
   - Unique resource systems per subclass:
     * Blood - Life force manipulation
     * Grit - Endurance and resilience
     * Edge - Precision and timing
   - Used strategically every 3-4 turns
   - Defines your playstyle and combat approach

3. TACTICAL TURN-BASED COMBAT
   - Setup vs. burst timing decisions
   - Resource management is key
   - Smart sequencing beats pure luck
   - Every roll matters

4. PROGRESSION SYSTEMS
   - Dice Shards: Permanent upgrades to your Attack Die
   - Ascension: Subclass-specific scaling and enhancements
   - Meta-progression between runs
   - Unlockable subclasses and abilities

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
-----------------

Tower of Greed emphasizes tactical dice-building over random chance. Players must:
- Plan their Attack Die configuration for optimal damage ranges
- Manage subclass resources for clutch moments
- Balance immediate power vs. long-term scaling
- Make meaningful choices about when to push higher vs. consolidate gains

The tower itself presents escalating challenges that reward preparation and adaptation, not just lucky rolls.
