## Critical Gaps Identified

### Positioning Ambiguity ❌
- Hero says "exploring creativity" instead of "I'm a [Role] specializing in [X, Y, Z]"
- **Fix:** Lead with job title + specialty areas

### Missing Impact Evidence ❌
- Projects describe approach but lack metrics or scale
- **Fix:** Add directional indicators ("50+ page design doc", "~60% alert reduction")

### Breadth vs. Depth Tension ⚠️
- 8 projects across 4 disciplines creates "generalist" perception
- **Fix:** Tier into "Core Expertise" (3-4) vs "Demonstrating Range"

### No Collaboration Context ❌
- Missing team sizes, stakeholder info, cross-functional work
- **Fix:** Add "teamContext" field to each project

### Hidden Credentials ❌
- UCSD degree only in structured data, not visible to recruiters
- **Fix:** Add Education section to About page

### No Social Proof ⚠️
- Missing testimonials, recommendations, awards
- **Fix:** Add 2-3 short quotes from collaborators

## Measurement & Iteration

### Success Metrics to Track
1. **Application callback rate** (target: +50-100% from baseline)
2. **Time to first interview** (target: -30% reduction)
3. **Recruiter engagement signals** (LinkedIn profile views, email inquiries)
4. **Portfolio analytics** (if implemented: time on page, bounce rate, project views)

### Iteration Cycle
1. Implement P0 tasks → Track for 2 weeks
2. Implement P1+P2 tasks → Track for 2 weeks
3. Measure conversion change
4. Adjust based on feedback from applications/interviews
5. Implement P3 tasks based on ROI validation

---

## Next Actions

1. **Review** full evaluation report ([HIRING_MANAGER_EVALUATION.md](./HIRING_MANAGER_EVALUATION.md))
2. **Prioritize** issues from follow-up list ([FOLLOW_UP_ISSUES.md](./FOLLOW_UP_ISSUES.md))
3. **Create GitHub issues** for committed tasks (use draft issues as templates)
4. **Sprint Planning:** Allocate 2-week sprint for P0+P1+P2 implementation
5. **Measure baseline:** Note current application/callback metrics before changes
6. **Implement changes:** Follow priority order (P0 → P1 → P2)
7. **Track results:** Monitor conversion metrics for 3-4 weeks post-implementation
8. **Iterate:** Refine based on real-world feedback
